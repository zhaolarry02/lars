This repository contains analysis programs for diagnosis of experiment equipment (e.g. data acquisition hardware, liquid argon purity), input setting performance (e.g. SiPM bias voltage, trigger parameters), and more. Plot histograms, scatter plots, curve fit parameters, etc. to measure the Rayleigh scattering length.
